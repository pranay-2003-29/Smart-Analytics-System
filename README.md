# Smart-Analytics-System
Smart Logistics Demand Prediction System is an end-to-end data engineering and machine learning platform designed to forecast daily shipment demand for logistics operations, with a focus on Indian startup use cases.
The system automates data ingestion and transformation through a Python-based ETL pipeline, stores processed data in a PostgreSQL data warehouse, and applies feature engineering to prepare data for machine learning. A Random Forest regression model is trained to predict daily logistics demand based on operational, temporal, and external factors such as city, order volume, distance, fuel price, holidays, and weather indicators.
The trained model is deployed as a RESTful API using Flask, enabling real-time demand predictions. An interactive Streamlit dashboard consumes this API to visualize historical demand trends and generate future demand forecasts, helping operations teams make data-driven decisions for fleet allocation, route planning, and capacity management.
This project demonstrates full-stack data engineering and ML engineering skills, including ETL design, data warehousing, model development, deployment, and analytics visualization, following production-style architecture and best practices.
